* Overview
** Purpose
  - This page is supposed to cover a project which is to memorize the
    Enchiridion by Epictetus.

** Inspiration
   - Similar to memorization of scripture or key works.  Most things
     come back to Epictetus and his teachings.  Also, I have received
     benefit from memorizing other key maxims and teachings.

* Rough Plan
  - Transcribe the entire Enchiridion.  For the following reasons:
    - Easier for familiarization and review.
    - Faster for me to type.
    - Attempt to automate certain techniques like the "first letter
      method." Which would at least help to compress + help recall.

  - Chunk off the entire Enchiridion into digestable pieces. Build a
    memory palace around the entire thing.  Optimize as we go by:

    - Creating and adding to a databse of short/filler/repetitive
      words.
      - Creating also images for common phrases.

** Enchiridion Memorization
  - There have been some accounts that James Stockdale memorised, or
    memorised big chunks of the Enchiridion.
    - In a recent [[https://fs.blog/knowledge-podcast/nancy-sherman/][Interview]] she noted:

      #+begin_quote
      I interviewed Stockdale very late in his life, you know, and he
      could kind of still memorize this little booklet by heart. It
      was quite remarkable to me. He really had internalized it. All
      this resonated with me and I had to think which stoic lessons
      are really the ones I want to endorse or promote.
      #+end_quote

          - There are some other web accounts that Stockdale had memorised
      this.

** Analysis

   - Some quick and dirty commands:
     #+begin_src 
     # cat | tr '[:space:]' '[\n*]' | grep -v "^\s*$" | sort | uniq -c | sort -bnr
     #+end_src
